1. created TOC.txt
Added a line: Hello
2. git status : showed us an untracked file : TOC.txt
3. git add TOC.txt 
4. git Status: now TOC.txt is staged (tracked), but not committed
5. modified TOC.txt
Added one more line: World
6. git status : TOC.txt is staged ; TOC.txt is modified post add
Right now if we commit the working directory, we will get the old added file of TOC.txt (with only Hello). Why? Because we used git add before modification. 
It means that only staged files are committed
7. If you want the modified file to be committed, pl add it to the staged area via the add command




Steps: Untracked Stage:

PS C:\Users\hcl4m\Desktop\GitEgs> git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean

Create a file : TOC.txt in the current folder



PS C:\Users\hcl4m\Desktop\GitEgs> git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        TOC.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)



..Steps : tracked stage:


PS C:\Users\hcl4m\Desktop\GitEgs> git add TOC.txt



PS C:\Users\hcl4m\Desktop\GitEgs> git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   TOC.txt
        
        
        
..Steps : Add content to file:

Add the content in the file TOC.txt:
This the TOC of the files for studies
Save the file.


PS C:\Users\hcl4m\Desktop\GitEgs> git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
Changes to be committed:

        new file:   TOC.txt
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

..Steps: Adding new content to staging area :

PS C:\Users\hcl4m\Desktop\GitEgs> git add TOC.txt


PS C:\Users\hcl4m\Desktop\GitEgs> git status
